# Northwestern CTEC Summarizer

## Overview

This project is a automation tool to help search and summarize Northwestern CTEC (Course and Teacher Evaluation Council) reviews.

The long-term goal is to input a course number (ex: `COMP_SCI 212`) and generate an AI-based summary of student feedback, including workload, difficulty, and professor feedback.

This is intended for my personal academic planning.
